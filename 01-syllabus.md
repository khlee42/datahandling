## Course Description
This course introduces students to the foundations of data handling and coding using Python, with an emphasis on applications in analytics. Students will learn how to manage, analyze, and visualize data using Python libraries and SQL, integrating these skills into a complete data workflow.

## Learning goals
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
* Understand and apply fundamental programming concepts in Python.
* Utilize Python libraries to read, manipulate, and visualize data.
* Perform basic data cleaning, wrangling, and analysis tasks.
* Use SQL for managing data in relational databases.
* Implement an end-to-end Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) workflow.
* Apply these skills in a final project, demonstrating their ability to work with real-world data.

## Evaluation

### Labs
Lab materials will be provided after each week’s module. These won’t be graded.

### Exercises (2*10=20%)
For each topic, students will have access to exercises designed to practice the skills taught in class. These exercises are created by DataCamp, an online education platform for coding, and include tutorials and coding questions in an interactive learning environment. Students can attempt each exercise as many times as needed until the due date, and a pass/fail grade will be assigned based on completion.

### Quizzes (4*5=20%)
There will be 4 in-class quizzes, each worth 5% of the total grade. More details will be announced later.

### Assignments (4*5=20%)
There will be 4 individual assignments where students will be tasked with writing Python code to answer specific questions. Submissions will be evaluated based on the correctness, design, and style of the code.

1. Scratch
2. API - Crypto price index
3. Data visualization
4. SQL - murder mystery

### Midterm exam (20%)
Multiple-choice questions will be used to assess both understanding and the ability to apply knowledge.

### Final project (20%)
In the capstone project of this course, students will apply the skills they've acquired to perform an end-to-end Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) process. Working with real-world data, students will extract information from an API of their choice, clean and transform the data, and then load it into a SQL database. After successfully housing the data, students will utilize Python visualization tools to reveal meaningful insights and trends. This project will provide hands-on experience in data handling and coding, encapsulating key aspects of the course and demonstrating students' mastery over the subject matter. A proposal, final presentation, and complete Google Colab notebook will be the primary deliverables for this project.
