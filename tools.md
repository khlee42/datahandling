## Google Colab
For this course, we'll be using Google Colab to run Python code. Colab is a free cloud service that provides a Jupyter notebook environment. It allows you to write and execute Python code in your browser, with no setup required. You can also share your notebooks with others and collaborate in real time. **You will need a Google account to use Colab.**
